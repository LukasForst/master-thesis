First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Sebastian Garcia,


I would like to say thank you to the whole Stratosphere Research Laboratory specifically to the Veronica Valeros, Maria Rigaki and Ondřej Lujáš for providing. 

\noindent
Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis.

This accomplishment would not have been possible without you.

Thank you.
