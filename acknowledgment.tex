\section*{Acknowledgment}
First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Sebastian Garcia for countless consultations, brainstormings and mainly for a significant amount of his time he invested in myself and this thesis. Thank you.

I would like to say thank you to the whole Stratosphere Research Laboratory specifically to the Veronica Valeros, Maria Rigaki and Ondřej Lukáš for providing me with all support I needed, for the proofreading of the thesis and for guiding me through the academic world.
I'm grateful for doing this work with you and to be part of the team in Stratosphere.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and my whole family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis.

This accomplishment would not have been possible without you.

Thank you.
