\begin{abstract}{Abstract}
Sharing the information about cybersecurity threats helps systems to prevent attacks even before they happen.
However, anytime when a system acts on received threat intelligence, it trusts the source, that published said intelligence.
Threat intelligence is nowadays mostly shared on public blocklists or centralized collaborative databases such as MISP.
Centralized authorities then have full control over the data source and can decide what will be published and what will be censored.

In this thesis, we solve the problem of centralized authorities by using peer-to-peer networks and we introduce a system for managing trust relationships during threat intelligence sharing \textbf{Fides}.
Fides is a generic trust model fine-tuned for sharing threat intelligence in highly adversarial global peer-to-peer networks of intrusion prevention agents.
