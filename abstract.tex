Most of the systems for network defense rely on evidence-based knowledge about the past cyberattacks - threat intelligence. To prevent the attacks even before they happen, the firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) rely on the shared threat intelligence generated by other systems.
Such intelligence is usually shared via public blocklists or centralized databases. 
However, a single centralized authority has then full control over what is going to be published and what is going to be censored. In addition to that, it is a central point of failure.

To mitigate a central point of failure, one can use peer-to-peer networks to share the threat intelligence. However, because these networks are open to anyone and even the malicious actors, the peers need to be able to determine who to trust a

In this thesis, we introduce Fides. Fides is a generic trust model fine-tuned for sharing threat intelligence in highly adversarial global peer-to-peer networks of intrusion prevention agents.
We build Fides with the lessons learned from other state of the art trust models and optimized it for the broad spectrum of environments in the public global peer-to-peer network where anybody can join and leave at any time.


% Sharing the information about cybersecurity threats helps systems to prevent attacks even before they happen.
% However, anytime when a system acts on received threat intelligence, it trusts the source, that published said intelligence.
% Threat intelligence is nowadays mostly shared on public blocklists or centralized collaborative databases such as MISP.
% Centralized authorities then have full control over the data source and can decide what will be published and what will be censored.
