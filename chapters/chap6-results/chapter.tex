\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents and evaluate the results of the simulations that were designed in the previous Chapter~\ref{ch:experiments}. 

Since there are too many different scenarios to evaluate each setup thoroughly, we mainly focus on evaluating Fides under specific conditions that verify its resilience. These conditions are the more important for the administrator, such as situations with many byzantine peers.

We focus on finding a scenario where there are as many adversarial peers as possible, and Fides is still able to guarantee that it can come up with the correct target score. This is worst case scenario that a trust model should 


Moreover, one can model each case in the simulation framework that is part of the published source code~\cite{fidesGithub} and thus, anybody can verify and simulate the scenario they are interested in.



Note that all figures in this chapter can be replicated by re-running the simulations in $simulations/cases/figures$~\cite{fidesGithub} Python package in the implementation.
The graphs may differ slightly because the threat intelligence and recommendations are sampled as described in Section~\ref{sec:sampling-threat-intelligence}, but the overall results should be the same.
