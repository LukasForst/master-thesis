\subsection{Terminology}
\textbf{The problem:} here I want to describe what terminology I'm using

\begin{itemize}
\item service trust - how much a trust model trust a peer to provide us a good service - it is not necessarily how much we trust the data we received from the peer as to the final computation we may include the information about peer's IP address from the Slips (what does Slips think about the IP address)
\end{itemize}
